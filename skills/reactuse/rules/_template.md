## Utils name

A short, one-line description of what the hook does.

## Usage

Describe the basic import and the minimal usage example. Always show destructured return values in the usage snippet (even if a full object is returned). If the utils supports alternative inputs or overloads (like tuple values or options), show a second short example. If the hook accepts a target, show both variants: with returned `ref` and with an explicit `target` argument.

## Example

Provide a concise component example that demonstrates a real UI use case and how the hook’s return values are used in JSX.

## Use cases

List 2-4 concise, real UI scenarios where the hook is useful. Keep each bullet short and practical (ex: tracking visibility for lazy loading, reacting to page focus changes).

## Notes

List important caveats and edge cases:

- uses browser APIs (if applicable)
- any usage specifics or gotchas to be aware of

## Type Declarations

Summarize the key public types and the main function signature. Keep it short and focused on what callers need to know.

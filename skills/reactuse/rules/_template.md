## Utils name

A short, one-line description of what the hook does.

## Usage

Describe the basic import and the minimal usage example. If the utils supports alternative inputs or overloads (like tuple values or options), show a second short example.

## Example

Provide a concise component example that demonstrates a real UI use case and how the hook’s return values are used in JSX.

## Notes

List important caveats and edge cases:

- event handler wrapping (if the hook accepts an optional override value)
- SSR behavior or client-only restrictions
- type constraints or required generics

## Type Declarations

Summarize the key public types and the main function signature. Keep it short and focused on what callers need to know.

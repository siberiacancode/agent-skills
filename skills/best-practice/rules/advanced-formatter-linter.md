# Formatter and linter

A **formatter** and a **linter** are tools that automatically maintain code quality and consistency. A formatter handles code appearance (indentation, line breaks, quotes). A linter catches logical issues, unused variables, and rule violations.

These tools are industry standard and used in most modern projects. They help teams keep a unified style, prevent errors early, and automate routine quality checks.

Popular tools include `prettier` for formatting and `eslint` for linting.
